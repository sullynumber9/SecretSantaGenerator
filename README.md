# SecretSantaGenerator
My friends and I are doing Secret Santa this year, but since we're all far away from each other, it's pretty hard for us to actually meet up and decide who gets who.  So, I coded a quick program to do it for us!  Fairly straightforward, just a simple BufferedWriter and a couple arrays! But be warned, it's not fully tested, so have an external party double check it over before you send out names!
